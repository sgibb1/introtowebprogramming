In this programming assignment you will be practicing JavaScript arrays and loops as well as the earlier material.

Your finished product should be a Github URL with one HTML and one JavaScript file inside it (One per group, collaborate on the assignment).

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Write a for loop that logs every even number starting from 1000 down to 0 (you can do this a couple ways, either updating the i a certain way or by checking if the number is even inside the for loop)

Write a for loop that starts at 0 and goes to 10000, don't log any numbers but when the for loop is 1/4 of the way done through the loops (2500), your code should alert a message that says "A quarter of the way there!" then when your loop is halfway there (5000), your code should alert  a message that says "Halfway there!"  Finally when it reaches the last number (10000, make sure your condition is inclusive of 10000) it should alert "The loop is done!"

Finally write an array of your top 5 favorite tv shows (make them up if you don't have any)

Loop through the array of your top 5 favorite tv shows and log to the console the following message each loop:

"My #<INSERT PROPER NUMBER HERE> favorite tv show is <INSERT TV SHOW HERE>"
