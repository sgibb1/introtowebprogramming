In this programming assignment you will be practicing JavaScript variables, built in functions, and conditionals.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub portfolio. I only need one person per group to submit a GitHub link. 

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Declare two variables firstName and lastName

Assign the firstName variable a string value of your first name

Assign the lastName variable a string value of your last name

Declare a third variable age and assign it a number value of your age (if you're self conscious about that like I am, feel free to put a fake age)

Fire an alert with the words "My name is [FULL NAME HERE]" using the values from your firstName and lastName variables

Fire an alert with the words "I am [AGE HERE] years old" using the value from your age variable

Write an if/else if/else block that checks the following 3 conditions:

If you're older than 21, fire an alert with the words "I am legally able to drink in the states."

If you're exactly 21, fire an alert with the words "I am just barely able to drink legally in the states."

If you're under 21, fire an alert with the words "It is illegal for me to drink in the states."

Finally, log a message in the console saying how much fun you are having in the class.

You must use the values from your variables in your messages and conditionals or you will lose points. A bug will also lose you points (Ex. You alert that you are 21 years old but 
your next message says it's illegal for you to drink in the states).
